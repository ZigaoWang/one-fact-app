## **One Fact - Open Source App Proposal**

### **What is One Fact?**
**One Fact** is a fun, educational app that delivers one interesting fact every day. It’s designed to help users slow down, take a break from the constant buzz of social media, and enjoy learning something new, one fact at a time. The app is 100% free, ad-free, and open source, offering a distraction-free learning experience.

### **Core Features**
- **Daily Fact:** Users receive one fact each day across various categories, such as history, science, technology, and more.
- **Relevant Articles:** For each fact, users can access a collection of related articles and resources to deepen their understanding.
- **AI-Powered Exploration:** Users can engage with an AI chatbot to dive deeper into the fact. The AI will provide additional context, answer questions, and guide users through a deeper learning journey about the topic.

### **How We Get the Data**
- **Open Data Sources:** We will source facts from open APIs like Wikipedia’s “Did You Know” section, Open Trivia DB, and NASA’s public APIs to ensure reliable and diverse content.
- **Curated Fact Database:** We will gather facts from public trivia databases like Random Trivia Generator and Fact Republic, and allow the community to contribute new facts.
- **AI-Generated Facts:** Optionally, we may use AI tools to generate fun and engaging facts, which will be manually verified before being published.

### **License**
**One Fact** will be open-source under the GNU General Public License v3, allowing anyone to contribute and collaborate while keeping the app free and accessible.

### **Monetization**
Since **One Fact** is entirely free and open source, there will be no ads or hidden costs. The focus is on creating a valuable learning experience for users. Possible future monetization options could include:
- Premium features like exclusive fact packs or advanced AI interactions.
- Merchandise or branded items like T-shirts or posters featuring popular facts.

### **Slogan**
"**Pause. Learn One Fact.**"

This slogan encourages users to step away from the rush of everyday life, focus on a single fact, and immerse themselves in learning.
